## About the dataset
The dataset contains data regarding the loans issued by a bank and corresponding features such as the CIBIL score of the person, credit history etc. The dependent variable here is the `target default`. Which shows wheter a person has defaulted on his loan or not. Some confidential row values are hashed and column names are given generic values due to privacy.
